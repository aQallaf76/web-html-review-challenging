    <h3 class="ET">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)</h3>
    <div><img src="img/et.jpg" alt="E T" width="500px">

        <p>A beloved classic for people of all ages, E.T. is a sci-fi masterpiece that takes a gentler approach to
            humanity’s first encounter with intelligent life in the cosmos. Elliott (Henry Thomas) is a lonely boy who
            lives with his single mother (Dee Wallace), his older brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton), and his younger
            sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore). One day, when he’s exploring in the backyard, Elliott senses something
            watching him. Sure enough, an alien spacecraft on a scientific mission to earth has mistakenly left behind
            one of their own. Putting aside his fears of the strange-looking creature, Elliott works to help E.T. find
            his way home before the government can get a hold of him.

        <img src="https://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/back-to-the-future-netflix-thumb-1200x9999.jpg">
        <p>One of the most beloved and influential sci-fi movies of all time is officially on Netflix. (As is Part II!)
            Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is an ordinary high schooler with a somewhat unpleasant life. He’s browbeaten
            by
            his principal at school, must endure the strained relationship between his nerdy father (Crispin Glover) and
            beautiful mother (Lea Thompson), and sees his father pushed around by middle-aged bully Biff (Thomas F.
            Wilson),
            Marty’s dad’s supervisor. However, when Marty’s eccentric scientist friend Doc (Christopher Lloyd) turns a
            DeLorean into a time machine, he inadvertently sends Marty back to the 1950s, just before his now-teenaged
            parents met and fell in love. Of course, his presence causes a stir, and it’s up to him to make sure his
            parents
            come together in the end or he will cease to exist.</p>

        <h4 class="Indiana Jones">Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)</h4>

            src="https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/best-netflix-movies-raiders-of-the-lost-ark-1200x9999.jpg">
        <p>There have been a few entries in the Indiana Jones franchise over the decades, but the first remains the
            best.
            Set in the 1930s, Raiders of the Lost Ark follows Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), a professor of archaeology
            who
            moonlights as an adventurer, exploring ancient ruins and plundering their treasures in the name of science.
            When
            he learns that Nazis are seeking the legendary Ark of the Covenant, Jones and his former lover Marion
            Ravenwood
            (Karen Allen) head to Egypt to find the Ark first. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a pitch-perfect throwback to
            classic pulp adventure stories, with a charming, wisecracking hero, nefarious villains, and spectacular set
            pieces sprinkled throughout a tight script.</p>

        <h4 class="third">The Irishman (2019)</h4>
        <img src="https://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/best-netflix-movies-the-irishman-1200x9999.jpg">

        <p>Martin Scorsese helped codify the gangster genre with films like Goodfellas and Casino, and now he’s
            returning to
            the genre with The Irishman, a film that plays many of the same notes as earlier gangster stories, but in a
            minor key. Based on historical events, the film follows Frank eventually doing jobs for crime boss Russell
            Bufalino (Joe Pesci). Over the years, Sheeran grows closer to union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), becoming
            his
            bodyguard and confidante, which leaves him in an awkward position when the mafia decides Hoffa is more
            trouble
            than he’s worth. The Irishman is a meditative crime drama, exploring the lives of its outlaw characters over
            decades of their lives; stripped of the usual glamor, it emphasizes the slow, routine corruption that drags
            Sheeran down.</p>

        <h4 class="fourth">Dolemite Is My Name (2019)</h4>

        <p>After a lengthy hiatus from the silver screen, Eddie Murphy returned in unusual but triumphant fashion. In
            Dolemite Is My Name, Murphy plays Rudy Ray Moore, a washed-up musician who completely transformed himself
            into
            the ’70s blaxploitation character Dolemite, becoming a cult star in the process. One of a string of movies
            Netflix made in 2019 in an attempt to break into the Oscars (successfully, though not with Dolemite), this
            is
            more provocative than your average Eddie Murphy comedy and sees one of the world’s most beloved comics
            capably
            take on one of his most nuanced, dramatic, although still hilarious roles ever.</p>

        <ul>

            <li> Genre: Comedy</li>

        <h4 class="fifth">El Camino (2019)</h4>
        <img src="https://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/el-camino-2-1200x9999.jpg">

        <p>Breaking Bad might not have needed a sequel — the finale provided excellent closure — but it got a great one
            anyway. El Camino follows Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), former disciple of meth kingpin Walter White (Bryan
            Cranston), picking up where the show left him: Speeding away from the compound where he’d been held
            prisoner,
            toward what then seemed an uncertain future. Now, Jesse is on the run from the law, trying to stay one step
            ahead with nothing but his wits and a gun. El Camino has the frantic pace that Breaking Bad was so good at,
            as
            Jesse stumbles from one setback to the next. It also maintains the crisp cinematography that made the show
            look
            so good.</p>
